## Windows

Windows support is reduced to the absolute minimum for maintainability.
Official Windows builds are done on AppVeyor within MSYS2 using this script, which can also work as a template for building locally: [scripts/appveyor.sh](../scripts/appveyor.sh).
Other methods of building may work, but will not be officially supported.
